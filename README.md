# PortfolioProject-Datacleaning-Using-SQL

Using NashvilleHousing Dataset I use SQL to get familiar with the dataset and begin prepping the data for Cleaning. Converting columns to the correct datatype, splitting
columns into new appropriate columns, deleting duplicates, and finally deleting the unused columns. This project has taught me that it's important to get to know your
data before you can start deleting it. Using Row_Number and the Partition By functions together helped me in figuring out how I wanted to delete the duplicate rows.
